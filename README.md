# Fundamentals Revision


A set of problems for revising core concepts - go to the index.html file and open it in google chrome.  There will be a folder with tests in each section.  These challenges are run in the browser and not in Node so you will not need to use `require` or `module.exports` at any point.  Just click on a link to a particular section and start practicing the problems.  Make the tests pass and refresh the broswer to see the tests pass.
